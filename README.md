### Pizza Calc

Pizza Calc is a pizza ingredients calculator. By using Pizza Calc you will be able to achieve the perfect pizza dough every time. By default, the app uses the metric system. However, if you happen to be from the US, you might enjoy the exclusive USA MODE, giving you access to features such as non-metric mode, as well as an American Flag in the Appbar. 

For pizza making sessions during the night, enjoy dark mode.
